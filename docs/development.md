# Bot development

Development for the bot is not much different than most Nodejs projects. There is a Discord server named "Curt" that is already created and is part of the `config.json` file in the `api3-discord-bot` project. The `api3-discord-bot` app is usually run locally but can also run in the same EC2 instance that production runs on. This may be appropriate after development changes are made to do a stage deployment using the Curt server.

## Curt server

For development you will need access to the Curt development server or create you own. Setting up a development server is complex in that you must mirror the categories, channels, and roles of the production Discord server. Contact an existing Admin for access via an invite link.

## Local repo

Setup is straight forward using the following guidelines.

### Step 1: `git clone`

```sh
git clone git@github.com:api3dao/api3-discord-bot.git
```

### Step 2: Add `config.json`file

Add a `config.json` file to your local repo. Its contents can be downloaded from the `config.json.example` file from Keybase. For access contact a Discord Admin.

Do not push the `config.json` file to the remote repo. Do not change the file name which is listed in `.gitignore`.

### Step 3: Run the app locally

```sh
cd api3-discord-bot
pnpm start-dev
```
