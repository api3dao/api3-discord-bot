# Overview

This project is a Discord bot for the API3 community, built with Node.js and the `discord.js` library. Its main features and structure are:

- **Purpose:** The bot moderates a Discord server by monitoring messages and reactions, enforcing rules, and automating moderation actions.
- **AI Moderation:** It uses a large language model (Anthropic Claude via OpenRouter) to analyze messages and decide if they violate server rules.
- **Message Handling:** When a user sends or edits a message, the bot checks it (with an AI prompt from a special channel) and, if necessary, deletes the message, times out the user, and logs the action.
- **Reaction Handling:** Moderators can react to log messages with special emojis to ban users or undo moderation actions.
- **Configurable:** Channel IDs, role IDs, and emoji triggers are set in a config file (not included in the repo for security).
- **Logging:** All moderation actions are logged and announced in designated channels.
- **Code Structure:**
  - index.js: Main entry, sets up the Discord client and event handlers.
  - handlers.js: Contains logic for handling messages and reactions.
  - llm.js: Handles AI moderation calls.
  - logger.js: Simple logging utility.
